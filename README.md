The goal of this project is to create a basic recipe website.  It will include an index page which contains links to other pages containing recipes.

This project will show a basic ability to create a small webpage.  This will include a basic boilerplate with a doctype, a root element (HTML), a head element containing metadata about the page, and a body element.

The body will contain a heading titled "Recipes" followed by an unordered list of recipes.  The recipes will be links to other pages which contain the ingredients and instructions for those recipes with pictures.
