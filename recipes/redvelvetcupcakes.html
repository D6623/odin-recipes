            </ul>
            
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather ingredients and preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit 
                    (175 degrees celsius). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.
                </li>

                <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt
                    in a medium bowl; set aside.
                </li>

                <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium
                    speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
                </li>

                <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food colour, and vanilla</li>

                <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not
                    over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
                </li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick insterted into a cupcake comes
                     out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
                     Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.
                </li>

                <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream,
                    and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners'
                    sugar until smooth.
                </li>

                <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>

                <li>Enjoy!</li>
