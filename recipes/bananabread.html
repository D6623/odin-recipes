                <li>Gather ingredients</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees celsius). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>

                <li>Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy;

                </li>
                <li>Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips;
                    pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted int the center comes out clean, about 70 mins.
