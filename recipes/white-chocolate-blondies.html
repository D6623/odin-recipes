            <li>1/2 cup of butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon of salt</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (175 degrees celsius). Grease a 
                9x9-inch baking pan.
            </li>

            <li>Melt together white chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over bearly
                simmering water; stir occasionally until smooth. Set aside to cool.
            </li>
                
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>

            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add sugar
                and vanilla with the mixture still running. Drizzle in white chocolate mixture; mix well.
                Stir in flour mixture with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold in chocolate chips.
                Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan.
            </li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean,
                about 25 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack before cutting into bars.
            </li>
